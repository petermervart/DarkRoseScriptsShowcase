# Dark Rose Script Showcase

## Description
This repository serves as a showcase of selected scripts from my game **Dark Rose**. These scripts demonstrate various features, mechanics, and functionalities.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is purely to highlight and demonstrate some of the technical aspects of my work. **No further updates will be made** to this repository, as it exists solely as a showcase of the work done.

## Usage
Feel free to browse through the scripts to understand the implementation and design choices. This project is meant for viewing purposes only, and itâ€™s not structured to be fully functional on its own.

**Note:** Since this repository is intended as a static showcase, there will be no future updates or changes.
